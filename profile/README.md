# Ask Clara
Ask Clara is building portfolio performance analytics and storytelling tools for wealth managers to help drive client engagement 
and improve understanding of investments. 
By helping client coverage teams build more compelling narratives, both in meetings and in written communications, 
our mission is to make every wealth client feel like they are your only client.

## Design Principles
At Ask Clara, we are passionate about bringing the best tech to our clients. 
To do this we have a few design principles that we use to guide our product, both its 
technical design and its purpose.

### Technology-First
Technology is at the core of Clara. 
By applying the latest technology standards, we are building a unified, coherent tool not contained by organisational silos. 
Thanks to our microservice architecture Clara benefits from fast recovery times and rapid product deployments to a range of client integrations. 

### Data Security
We know how important your data is. 
We actively seek out best-in-class security practices and embed them at the core of our development practices. 
Using strict standards, we protect your data using multiple layers of security.

### Knowledge Compounding 
Never forget anything. 
Clara enables all employees to consistently have access to the same pool of information. 
This decreases the oversight required to ensure your firm’s views are represented coherently across clients and over time.

### Personalisation at Scale
Clara works for you. 
We tailor each individual analysis to your clients’ preferences to streamline your preparation process. 
With Clara you can provide a highly personal service at a fraction of your time 


## Our Codebase
We are currently working in stealth mode, thus all our work is private.
Moreover, given the security required in this space we will be very selective in what we share with the
public eye.
